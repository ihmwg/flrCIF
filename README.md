[flrCIF](flrCIF.dic) provides the data representation for
capturing the details of Fluorescence / FRET experiments. 

The restraints derived from these experiments can be combined with spatial restraints
from other experiments to determine the structures of macromolecular assemblies using 
integrative/hybrid (I/H) methods. The I/H structures are archived in the
[PDB-dev](https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org) prototype system.

[flrCIF](flrCIF.dic) provides the defintions required to handle the restraints obtained from
FRET experiments and the structural models derived from them. This dictionary is an extension of the 
[PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary and the [IHM-dictionary](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary).

The [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary is used by the [wwPDB](http://www.wwpdb.org) to
archive structures of macromolecules determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscory
and three-dimensional Electron Microscopy.
The [IHM-dictionary](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary) provides the additional defintions 
required to handle structures derived using integrative/hybrid methods.
For details regarding the IHM-dictionary, refer to the 
[IHM-dictionary documentation](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHM-dictionary/blob/master/dictionary_documentation/documentation.md).
