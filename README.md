[flrCIF](base/mmcif_ihm_flr-core.dic) provides the data representation for
capturing the details of Fluorescence / FRET experiments. 

The restraints derived from these experiments can be combined with spatial restraints
from other experiments to determine the structures of macromolecular assemblies using 
integrative modeling methods. The integrative structures are archived in the
[PDB-IHM](https://pdb-ihm.org) prototype system.

[flrCIF](base/mmcif_ihm_flr-core.dic) provides the defintions required to handle the restraints obtained from
FRET experiments and the structural models derived from them. This dictionary is an extension of the 
[PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary and the [IHMCIF](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHMCIF) dictionary.

The [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary is used by the [wwPDB](http://www.wwpdb.org) to
archive structures of macromolecules determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscory
and three-dimensional Electron Microscopy.
The [IHMCIF](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHMCIF) dictionary provides the additional defintions 
required to handle structures derived using integrative modeling methods.
For details regarding the IHMCIF dictionary, refer to the 
[IHMCIF dictionary documentation](https://github.com/ihmwg/IHMCIF/blob/master/dictionary_documentation/documentation.md).
